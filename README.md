# Heroku Splunk app

This Splunk app is compatible with the [Splunk Common Information Model for Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/5.0.1/User/Web).

## Source types

* `heroku:router`, request logs produced by the Heroku HTTP routers.
* `heroku:system`, messages about actions taken by the Heroku platform.
* `heroku:api`, messages about Heroku app administrative actions taken by users.
